  <h2>What makes a person?</h2>
  <p>While we take inspiration from our brain for the design of Neural Networks, our efforts of reverse engineering our brain through software design and computer architecture has left us a new perspective on human perception and what REALLY makes a person, and how one is unique. 
    Everyone goes through different experiences, from the moment light shines through our retina and fires electrical signals to our neurons. We process data differently, where each neuron possessing a unique activation function not just within a person, but compared to all people. 
    Some have a larger and more active prefrontal cortex, while some may naturally have disabilities in cognitive and emotional functions. As time goes by, our brain develops as we often colloquially call "muscle memory", which in the end, shapes who we are.
    <br>
    <br>
    Naturally, there comes a unique appreciation of the world we live in, fueled by Science and Innovation, yet inevitably, as civilization progresses and history continues to be written, we think about fundamental so called "philosophical" problems that comes in the package of being human. However, some still remain a mystery in my mind. 
    Music come down to the manipulation of sound emission at different frequencies, and so it lies outside the bounds of human language, such as the 26 alphabets in the English language. The language of music extends to the entire audible bandwidth, which brings me at least to unimaginable depths of emotions and an appreciation to the craft, which is a process that in the case of Western classical music, has actively evolved for the past 6 centuries.
    <br>
    <br>
    So this is me, on an seemly endless (and sometimes stressful) marathon to explore the endless possibilities of this world shaped by the formulas of fundamental physics.
